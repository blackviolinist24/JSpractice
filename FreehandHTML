    <p>Hello there my name is Michael Davis, and I am learning how to code for the first time using as many tools and resources as possible such as freecodecamp.com and youtube with a combination of udemy courses. If you have any tips for learning advance HTML, CSS, or JavaScript feel free to message me on github, I'm always open to new ways to learn.
